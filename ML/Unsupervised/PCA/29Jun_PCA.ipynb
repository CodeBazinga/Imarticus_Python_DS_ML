    "3) So after applying PCA, we can apply Regression, Classification or even Clustering<br> \n",
    "4) Principal components so generated remove noise by reducing a large number of features to just a couple of principal components. Principal components are orthogonal projections of data onto lower-dimensional space.<br>\n",
    "5) In theory, PCA produces the same number of principal components as there are features in the training dataset. In practice, though, we do not keep all of the principal components. Each successive principal component explains the variance that is left after its preceding component, so picking just a few of the first components sufficiently approximates the original dataset without the need for additional features.<br>"

    "a)\tEigenvectors and eigenvalues are the linear algebra concepts that we need to compute from the covariance matrix in order to determine the principal components of the data.<br>\n",
    "b)\tPrincipal components are new variables that are constructed as linear combinations or mixtures of the initial variables. These combinations are done in such a way that the new variables (i.e., principal components) are uncorrelated and most of the information within the initial variables is squeezed or compressed into the first components. So, the idea is 10-dimensional data gives you 10 principal components, but PCA tries to put maximum possible information in the first component, then maximum remaining information in the second and so on.<br>\n",

    "#### 4) Feature Vector\n",
    "a) Computing the eigenvectors and ordering them by their eigenvalues in descending order, allow us to find the principal components in order of significance. In this step, what we do is, to choose whether to keep all these components or discard those of lesser significance (of low eigenvalues), and with the remaining ones form a matrix of vectors that we call Feature vector.<br>\n",
    "b) So, the feature vector is simply a matrix that has as columns the eigenvectors of the components that we decide to keep. This makes it the first step towards dimensionality reduction, because if we choose to keep only p eigenvectors (components) out of n, the final data set will have only p dimensions.\n"
