    "a) The Silhouette Score and Silhouette Plot are used to measure the separation distance between clusters. <br>\n",
    "b) It displays a measure of how close each point in a cluster is to points in the neighbouring clusters. <br>\n",
    "c) This measure has a range of [-1, 1] and is a great tool to visually inspect the similarities within clusters and differences across clusters.<br>\n",
    "d) The Silhouette Score is calculated using the mean intra-cluster distance (a) and the mean nearest-cluster distance (b) for each sample. The Silhouette Coefficient for a sample is (b-a) / max(a,b).<br>\n",
    "e) b is the distance between each sample and the nearest cluster that the sample is not a part of while a is the mean distance within each cluster.<br>\n",

    "a: The mean distance between a sample and all other points in the same class.<br>\n",
    "b: The mean distance between a sample and all other points in the next nearest cluster<br>\n",
